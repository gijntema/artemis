# Input parameter description to interpret the parameters of the model that are adaptable

In this file the different inputs (parameters) that can be defined in any config .csv file. 
A legend is given for each column in the config template file, displaying what the input parameters entails
and, if known what the limits of the parameter are. If the parameter is limited to a fixed set of string values, 
these are discussed further below the main table. All functionality reported here are used in running  
`ARTEMIS.py` as it exists in the version of 15 February 2022.
